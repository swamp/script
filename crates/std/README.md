# Swamp Standard Library

The official optional standard library for the [Swamp programming language](https://github.com/swamp/swamp).

## Overview

`swamp-std` provides a collection of commonly needed, reusable functions and data structures that are helpful for everyday programming tasks in Swamp. It builds upon the minimal set of types and intrinsics defined in `swamp-core`, offering a richer toolkit without being required by the language compiler.

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
swamp-std = "0.1.10"
```
