releases:
  v0.0.8:
    date: "2024-12-30"
    notice: 
    sections:
      General:
        changes:
          fixed:
            - Wrapping Option values for assignments when needed
            - Do not wrap `none` with option
            - Enum variant structs, `ResolvedEnumLiteralData::Struct`, handle fields in source code order

          added:
            - Keyword `use` reads and parses the specified files.
            - Add `MutStructFieldRef` for location of mutable struct field reference

          improved:
            - More errors have `Span` information

          refactor:
            - Use `Rc<RefCell<T>>` for `Value` containers, to easier give out locations (MutRef).
            - Pest errors should not leak through the codebase.
            - Reference separate from Value to have a clear distinction between mutable references and normal values (and to avoid infinite accidental recursion).
        
          test:
            - Add more test to have better coverage for parser and analyzer

          removed:
            - Type aliases

  v0.0.5:
    date: "2024-12-06"
    notice: |
      - Array extends, push, remove and clear.
      - Fixed bug where empty parameters caused return type to be `Unit`.
      - Map assignment and map type.
      - Optional operator in if statements and if-expressions.
      - `none` keyword
      
  v0.0.4:
    date: "2024-12-03"
    notice: |
      - Add context to Interpreter
      - Separate out external functions
      - Split up resolve_definition and insert_definition

  v0.0.3:
    date: "2024-12-02"
    notice: |
      Static calls (`StructType::function(parameters)`), type alias (`type MyAlias = (Int, Float)`) and unification of external, internal and member functions.
